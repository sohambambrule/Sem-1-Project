# Sem-1-Project
This project outlines the development of an Intelligent Energy Management System to solve the problem of high, uncontrolled household electricity consumption by providing real-time data and remote control. The system utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller to accurately measure and calculate True Power (Watts) using specialized non-invasive sensors. This data is then transmitted to an IoT cloud platform (e.g. Blynk ) for logging, analysis, and triggering alerts. The user interacts with the system via Blynk application, which displays real-time voltage, current, and power readings, provides essential consumption trend analysis, and allows the user to switch off an electric appliance, upon receiving an instant mobile notification for detecting high usage.
